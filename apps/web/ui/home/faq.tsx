    question: "What happens when I exceed the click limit on my plan?",
    answer:
      "If you exceed your monthly click limits, your existing links will still work, but you need to upgrade to the Pro plan to view their stats or add more links.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use the free plan for commercial purposes?",
    answer: `Yes, absolutely! We want to make sure that everyone can use Phunq for free, whether it's for personal or commercial use. However, we do have a fair use policy in place to prevent abuse. If you exceed the fair use policy, we may ask you to upgrade to the Pro plan.`,
  },
  {
    question: "Can I cancel my subscription at any time?",
    answer: `Yes, you can cancel your subscription at any time. If you cancel your subscription, you will still be able to use Phunq until the end of your billing period. After that, you will be downgraded to the free plan.`,
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer refunds?",
    answer: `We currently do not offer refunds. However, you can cancel your subscription at any time, after which you won't be charged again. We are constantly working on improving Phunq, so this might change in the future.`,
